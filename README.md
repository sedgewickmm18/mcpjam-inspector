MCPJam is the development platform for MCP servers, MCP apps, and ChatGPT apps.

- **Debug**: Inspect every JSON-RPC message and OAuth exchange across host configurations with full traces.
- **Chat**: Talk to any LLM against your server with full trace visibility into tool calls and context across agent, host app, your server.
- **Inspect**: Explore your server’s tools, resources, and prompts in one place.
- **Evaluate**: Run evals across multiple LLMs and track accuracy over time so you catch regressions early.
- **CLI**: Probe servers, run doctor checks, exercise OAuth flows, and list tools/resources/prompts straight from your terminal.
- **SDK**: Programmatically drive inspections, snapshot server capabilities, and assert on tool/resource shapes from your own tests.
- **CI/CD**: Wire the CLI and SDK into GitHub Actions (or any pipeline) to run e2e tests, evals, OAuth checks, and spec conformance on every PR.

No more ngrok or ChatGPT/Claude subscription needed. MCPJam is the fastest way to iterate on any MCP project.

### 🚀 Quick Start

Open the hosted web app. No install needed.

👉 [app.mcpjam.com](https://app.mcpjam.com)

Or run MCPJam locally for HTTP/S and local STDIO servers:

```bash
npx @mcpjam/inspector@latest
```

# Installation Guides

MCPJam Inspector runs three ways: a hosted web app, a desktop app for Mac and Windows, or via your terminal. The web app is HTTPS-only and has no install. Terminal and Desktop support HTTP/S and local STDIO servers.

### Requirements

[![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-20+-green.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js)](https://nodejs.org/)
[![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-5+-blue.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

Node.js 20+ is only required for the terminal install (`npx`). The hosted web app and desktop apps have no local runtime requirements.

## Hosted Web App

Open [app.mcpjam.com](https://app.mcpjam.com) in your browser. No install required. Always on the latest version, and you can share MCP server links with teammates the same way you'd share a Google Doc.

- HTTPS MCP server URLs only (for HTTP or local STDIO servers, use Desktop or Terminal).
- No STDIO, tunneling, skills, or tasks. Those require the local inspector.

See [Hosted App docs](https://docs.mcpjam.com/hosted/overview) for details.

## Desktop App

Download the installer for your OS. Supports HTTP/S and local STDIO servers. No Node.js required.

- [Install Mac](https://github.com/MCPJam/inspector/releases/latest/download/MCPJam.Inspector.dmg)
- [Install Windows](https://github.com/MCPJam/inspector/releases/latest/download/MCPJam-Inspector-Setup.exe)

## Terminal

Run the inspector via `npx` (supports HTTP/S and local STDIO):

```bash
npx @mcpjam/inspector@latest
```

After it starts, open the printed `localhost` URL in your browser.

## Docker

Run MCPJam Inspector using Docker, bound to localhost for security:

```bash
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:6274:6274 mcpjam/mcp-inspector
```

The app is available at `http://127.0.0.1:6274`. Always use `-p 127.0.0.1:6274:6274` (not `-p 6274:6274`) to keep the inspector local-only. On macOS/Windows, connect to host MCP servers via `http://host.docker.internal:PORT` instead of `127.0.0.1`.

## App Builder

Debug your server against a model using tool calls or in-panel chat, with Chat, Trace, and Raw views. Supports OpenAI Apps SDK and MCP app UIs, text tools, and a Chrome DevTools-style widget emulator to iterate on widgets locally.

- Manually invoke a tool to instantly view the widget, or chat with your server using an LLM.
- View all JSON-RPC messages and `window.openai` messages in the logs.
- Change emulator device to Desktop, Tablet, or Mobile views.
- Test your app's locale change, CSP permissions, light / dark mode, hover & touch, and safe area insets.

<img alt="MCPJam App Builder trace view" src="./docs/images/app-builder-trace.png">

_Trace view: every tool call, agent step, and JSON-RPC message._

## Chat

Multi-server chat on frontier models for free, or bring your own API key. Chat, Trace, and Raw views; compare up to 3 models side-by-side. View your server's token usage.

<img alt="MCPJam Chat comparing frontier models side by side" src="./docs/images/side-bears.png">

## OAuth Debugger

Guided MCP OAuth conformance checks with step-by-step explanations. Test against every version of the OAuth spec (03-26, 06-18, and 11-25). Support for client pre-registration, Dynamic Client Registration (DCR), and Client ID Metadata Documents (CIMD).

<img alt="MCPJam OAuth Flow Debugger" src="./docs/images/oauth-debugger.png">

## MCP Server Debugging

MCPJam contains all of the tooling to test your MCP server. Manually run tools, resources, resource templates, prompts, and elicitation flows, with full JSON-RPC observability. MCPJam has all features from the original inspector and more.

<img alt="MCPJam MCP Tools" src="./docs/images/mcp-tools.png">

## Skills

Use Skills in Chat and App Builder to extend models with local, reusable behaviors. Local filesystem only. Your data never leaves your machine. [Read more](https://docs.mcpjam.com/inspector/skills)

## Workspaces

Group your servers into shared workspaces with real-time team sync, so everyone on your team is testing against the same configuration. [Read more](https://docs.mcpjam.com/inspector/workspaces)

## Evals

Define test cases with expected tool calls and run them across multiple LLMs. Track accuracy metrics over time to catch regressions early and improve your server with every iteration. [Read more](https://docs.mcpjam.com/inspector/test-cases)

## CLI

Run MCPJam from the terminal for fast local dev loops and CI integration. Probe servers, run OAuth checks, inspect tools and resources, and execute evals without leaving your shell. [Read more](https://docs.mcpjam.com/cli/overview)

## SDK

Programmatic access to MCPJam for custom tooling, scripting, and integrations. Build your own workflows on top of MCPJam's inspection and evaluation primitives. [Read more](https://docs.mcpjam.com/sdk)

## CI/CD

Wire MCPJam into GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or your CI system of choice to run conformance, E2E tests, and evals on every PR. Catch MCP server regressions before they ship. [Read more](https://docs.mcpjam.com/cli/ci)

## Local Development

After cloning the repo, install dependencies and use the dev launcher script:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### `mcpjam-dev.sh` — Smart build-if-stale launcher

The script automatically detects which components (SDK, CLI, Inspector) are stale and rebuilds only what's needed before launching.

**Start the web-based Inspector** (equivalent to `npx @mcpjam/inspector@latest` but with your local fixes):

```bash
./mcpjam-dev.sh inspector                              # starts on port 6274
./mcpjam-dev.sh inspector --no-open                    # don't open browser
./mcpjam-dev.sh inspector --port 8080                  # custom port
./mcpjam-dev.sh inspector --config mcp-config.json     # auto-connect to servers
./mcpjam-dev.sh inspector -- npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-everything
```

**Run the mcpjam CLI:**

```bash
./mcpjam-dev.sh server probe -- npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-everything
./mcpjam-dev.sh tools list
./mcpjam-dev.sh --help
```

**How it works:**

1. Compares source file timestamps against `dist/` outputs for each component
2. Rebuilds only stale components in dependency order (SDK → CLI or Inspector)
3. Launches the requested tool with all forwarded arguments
