/**
 * Project-level runtime overrides the inspector client computes via

 * same MCPServerConfig the legacy `{serverConfig}` body would have.
 *
 * One source of truth for the wire shape: client encoder
 * (`state/mcp-api.ts`) and server decoder (`utils/local-server-resolver.ts`)
 * both import from here, so a field added on one side is impossible to
 * forget on the other.
